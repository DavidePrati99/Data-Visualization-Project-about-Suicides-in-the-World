# Data-Visualization-Project-about-Suicides-in-the-World

The purpose of this report is not to understand why people are led to take
their own lives, but to study how this phenomenon varies across the world and
if there are predominantly factors, such as wealth index and unemployment
rate, to take in consideration.

It consists in the creation of many useful infographics, to understand the data and to highlight specific characteristics and trends, and then in the evaluation of clarity,
utility, informativeness and beauty of the infographics by users, that were profiled and had to follow a Cabitza-Lococoro psychometric questionnaire provided by us.
